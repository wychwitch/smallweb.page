                        <p>it doesnt need to have a purpose. its the same as a blank canvas. you're supposed to fill it with your art, your creativity.</p>
                        <p>dont worry about keeping a single theme or narrative or set of rules. its a way to express your thoughts.</p>
                        <p>DONT use those giant web frameworks that take forever to load. use minimal javascript. stay away from analytics.</p>

                        <h3>Any other pieces of advice? how about specific resources?</h3>
                        <p>look at the source of other websites to learn how they achieved their style and layout</p>

                        <p>(press F12)</p>

                        <h3>Any final thoughts?</h3>
                        <p>do it for you, not other people</p>

                        <p>don't be intimidated by the idea that you have to learn html/css/javascript to make a website! your site doesn't have to be professional or use any coding best practices. you can totally get away with just googling whatever you're trying to do and copying code snippets! plus, small web communities usually have plenty of people who'd love to help you if you get stuck :) just go for it, you're not trying to please anybody but yourself!</p>

                        <h3>Any other pieces of advice? how about specific resources?</h3>
                        <p>Use inspect element, both on your own site and others. On yours, it makes it easier to adjust the layout since it edits in real-time. Use it on other's peoples sites when you see something cool and think "hey I wanna do that!"</p>

                        <p>Divide and label everything, and I mean everything. You'll be saving yourself so much trouble down the line if you can find stuff easily, and if you can edit individual chunks.</p>

                        <h3>If there's one piece of advice you could give to someone starting out, what would it be?</h3>
                        <p>HTML and CSS are really simple tools that can be used to make really complex things. I would recommend people think of webweaving as a never-ending process of creating a work of living art rather than a finished product. A website is always growing- just like we as people are! While yes coding a website is a tech thing- it’s the blurry line between art and tech where it really shines.</p>

                        <h3>Any other pieces of advice? how about specific resources?</h3>
                        <p>Don’t create with your audience in mind. The modern web has turned us into performers. You want your site to be an extension of yourself- not the other way around. Make it messy- make it silly- who cares if it’s responsive- life is messy- let your site emulate the interior you.</p>

                        <h3>Any final thoughts?</h3>
                        <p>The small web movement isn’t about breaking up corporations- it’s about eliminating the effect of Capitalism on the creative cyber space of the internet. The reason so many small web folks love the Old Web aesthetics is because the Old Web was created by creatives and rarely for any monetary gain or profit. The nostalgia is for an internet where it was a novelty for a corporation to have a website and common for a person to have one. Now it’s a novelty for a person to have a website and a REQUIREMENT for a company to have one.</p>
